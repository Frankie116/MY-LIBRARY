## CLOUDFORMATION-templates

The purpose of this repo is to create a library of Cloudformation templates that can be used interchangably within projects.  

Each template encapuslates an area of AWS infrastructure that can be put together quickly to create a network of various resources.

This repo is a work in progress.
